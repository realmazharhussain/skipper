# Features for the Future

## Focused Zoom/Crop

Zoom or Crop video as much as possible while still showing the important (selected) content completely.

## Auto Skip

Automatically skip certain parts of the video/audio.

## Quality Selection

When watching online video/audio (e.g. from YouTube) or even local media with multiple tracks, show an option to choose different quality/track.

## Drag-n-Drop Media Links

When browsing the web, instead of clicking on a YouTube video, user could drag a YouTube video from the browser into the media player to play it.

*Dragging a video from Firefox drags its URL. So, the media player only needs to have drop support for URLs (which are text but just a little more special).*
